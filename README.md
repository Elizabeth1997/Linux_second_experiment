There are three c language source code documents. oneQ.c,twoQ.c and threeQ.c.
oneQ.c is used to satisfy the functions of showing the string "Hello, world!" to the computer screen.
twoQ.c is used to achieve the function of copying a txt to another(if it dosen't exit, program should create one),then change all the lowercase in the contest into uppercase.
ThreeQ.c is more complicated than above. It needs to create a father process and its child process.The child will print string "Hello, CSU" repeatably and never stop util the father sends it a signal to terminate.
